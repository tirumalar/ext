I got a warning from Dreamhost on 2012-02-15 that this site might be compromised due to a flaw in the theme I am using for Wordpress.

**I haven't found any malicious code, but just to be sure:**

If you have downloaded an installer for logview4net from here, please run an anti virus scanner on your computer.

I have re-uploaded new installers so they should be fine now, but I was in a bit of panic mode so I didn't check the old ones before I deleted them. There is probably nothing to worry about, and most downloads are from uncompromised files at SourceForge.

If you see something weird on the site, or get malware warnings, please let me know.
