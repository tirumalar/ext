I am nearly done implementing RegEx instead of plain text matching.

I will create a new release when there is enough information on this site to stop redirecting people to [jsisoft.com](http://jsisoft.com)

I intend to make each part of the documentation a post here and use tags to keep some structure to it. That way it will be much easier to comment or contribute on individual parts of the documentation.

It will go past the [SourceForge Tracker](http://sourceforge.net/projects/logview4net/), but a suggestion in a comment here will get to me a bit faster.
