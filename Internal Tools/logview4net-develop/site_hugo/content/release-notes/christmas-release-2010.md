... is what the release I made today was going to be. Well here it is, finally.

Please let me know how you use it and if you figure out a listener or other feature you are missing.

**The changelog for release 11.02 is:**
* Fixed: [3048596] logview4net keeps redrawing view, even though it is Paused
* Fixed: [2865511] F11 vill now hide/show the menu and the form border.
* Fixed: An exception was sometimes thrown when closing a session window because the listener was not closed before the view.
* Changed: The string pattern for an action is now a regular expression, not only an exact match.
* Fixed: [3094649] tables list not retrieved when db name contains a period
* Fixed: [2833781] HighlightMatch highlighting is offset by -1
