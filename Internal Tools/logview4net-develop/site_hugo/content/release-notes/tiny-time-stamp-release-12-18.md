The 12.18 release of logview4net adds the timestamp option to SqlListener, MySqlListener and EventLogListener.

I'm still trying to get my head around adding column headers to the data where applicable, but it's not as easy as it seems. Multiple listeners and infrequent data feeds does complicate matters.

Have a nice weekend.
