/*
* Project Description:
* This is a sample bootloader program demonstrating PSoC 5LP bootloading PSoC 4.
* The project is tested using two DVKs - One with PSoC 4 on CY8CKIT-042 and 
* the second one with PSoC 5LP on CY8CKIT-050. PSoC 4 must be programmed with
* this Program.
*
* Connections Required
* CY8CKIT-050 (PSoC 5LP DVK) :
*  P0[0] - Rx -  connected to Tx of PSoC4
*  P0[1] - Tx -  connected to Rx of PSoC4 
*  P6.1 is internally connected to SW1 on DVK.
*
* CY8CKIT-042 (PSoC 4 DVK) : PSoC  4 intially programmed with UART_Bootloader program.
*  P0[0] - Rx - Connected to Tx of PSoC 5LP
*  P0[1] - Tx - Connected to Rx of PSoC 5LP
*  P0.7 is internally connected to SW1 on DVK.
*
* Note that the GNDs of both DVKs should be connected together.
*
* The main()function of this program calls the CyBtldr_Start() API. This API
* performs the entire bootload operation. It communicates with the host. 
* After a successful bootload operation, this API passes control to the application
* via a software reset.
*
* There are two bootloadable projects: Bootloadable1 (blinks the Green LED) and 
* Bootloadable2 (blinks the Blue LED). With successive bootload operation, 
* alternate bootloadables will be programmed onto the target. 
*
* The following events happen on each trigger of the switch P6 [1] of 
* CY8CKIT – 050 (PSoC 5LP):
*
* On first switch press, Bootloadable1.cyacd file will be bootloaded onto the 
* target PSoC 4. On successful bootloading the message “Bootloaded - Green” 
* will be displayed on CY8CKIT – 050 LCD and the Green LED starts blinking 
* on the CY8CKIT – 042.
*
* For subsequent bootloading operation press the switch P0[7] on CY8CKIT – 042.
* This makes PSoC 4 to enter bootloader and be ready to bootload a new application.
*
* On next switch press on CY8CKIT – 050, Bootloadable2.cyacd file will be 
* bootloaded onto the target PSoC 4. On successful bootloading the message 
* “Bootloaded - Blue” will be displayed on CY8CKIT – 050 LCD and the Blue LED 
* starts blinking on the CY8CKIT – 042.
