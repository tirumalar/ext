I think I have annoyed enough users and it is not worth the money.

**The big download button now gives you a clean installer without bundled software.**

There is still a link to the installer with software offers that you can use if you feel brave and generous.

The latest software offers that obfuscates the cancel and decline buttons by making them look disabled are really nasty. I could still sleep knowing some users might feel tricked into install crap, but having a large user base feeling forced to accept it is not very pleasant.
