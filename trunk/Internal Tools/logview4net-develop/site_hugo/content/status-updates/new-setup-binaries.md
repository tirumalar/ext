I appreciate all you users who have downloaded  and installed logview4net even though it currently has a horrible installer that more or less forces you to install a lot of crap.

**Please note that you can click the grey 'Cancel' and 'Decline' buttons even though they look disabled.**

If you'd rather have a clean installer you can use the link bellow the button.

I will remove the software bundle as soon as I make it enough to get paid from InstallMonetizer.

This week I got a very nice donation so I plan to buy a code signing certificate to make the installer look less suspicious to the browsers.
