This resease was initiated by an error report from a user and due to my development environment I decided to bite the bullet and use a more recent version of the .Net Framework. 
I will probably do a lot of work on the graphics now that I can use WPF instead of WinForms.
 
I did not sign this release so Windows will complain about it having an unknown publisher. I publish Sha256 hashes of the installer on the site and on [GitHub](http://github.com/idstam/logview4net) if you want to verify it before installing.
Please let me know if you find any errors or come up with an awesome idea that you think would fit in logview4net.
