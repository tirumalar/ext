Yesterday I made a small release fixing a bug and another small issue.

The bug probably made the [folder listener](/documentation/folder-listener/) unusable since it wrote the names of the application internal objects instead of the actual content.

The small fix is that a change of the name of a running [session](/documentation/configure-overview/) now will update the title of the session window.

Thanks to a nice donation I am about to buy a certificare so that I can sign the installer. Hopefully that will remove a lot of the browser warnings when downloading it.
