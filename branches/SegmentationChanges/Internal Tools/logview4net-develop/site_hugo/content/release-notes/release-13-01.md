This is a small release that fixes a bug that I introduced with the ability to save all events to a file.

I also removed an unnecessary binary and got the install package a bit smaller.



**Change log:**
`13.01
Removed a binary component, a launcher, that wasn't doing anything useful.
Fixed bug in the rolling file storage that stopped polling listeners from running when there were more than one new line/message.
