As I noted in the [previous post](/status-updates/encoding-in-the-rsslistener/); code wise this release is for a small fix that have a big impact on the RssListener.

I had crippled the handling of [character encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) in the xml stream for feeds.

The other change I've made is that I got a code signing certificate from [Comodo](http://www.comodo.com/e-commerce/code-signing/code-signing-certificate.php)

This should make the download a bit nicer in Internet Explorer.
