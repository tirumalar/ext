Here's a release with a new user action and the possibility to have timestamps for some listeners.
I'll add timestamps to the other listeners as fast as I can.

`
CHANGELOG:
12.17
Added a user action that will execute any bat,cmd or exe when a pattern is found.
Added timestamp to UdpListener, FileListener, FolderListener, RssListener, 
		StdOutListener, TcpListner and UdpListener. 
		Using the date format documented here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4.aspx
