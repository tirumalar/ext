Finally I've had some time to make a new release.

Most notable is that you can choose to save all events to a rolling log file.

**Here are the changes for 12.44:**

* Added option to save all events to a rolling log file
* Added an option to the viewer to skip the listener headers for messages. Only Tcp and Udp was affected.
* Fixed bug: Not saving all config data for UserActions
* Fixed request: An option to remove white space surrounding messages.
