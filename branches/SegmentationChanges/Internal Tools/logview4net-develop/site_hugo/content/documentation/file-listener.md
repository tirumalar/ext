File Listener does a tail on a file.



	
  * File: Full path to the file to monitor.

	
  * Poll intervall: How often, in milliseconds, the file should be checked.

	
  * Prefix: A small text that is shown before the event in the viewer to indicate  where the event came from.

	
  * Start at end: Whether or not to show all current data in the file or only show new  data.
